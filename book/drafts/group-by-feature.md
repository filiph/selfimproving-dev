Talk about feature-focused structure of code. [Like so](https://dev.to/jamesmh/the-life-changing-and-time-saving-magic-of-feature-focused-code-organization-1708).

Start with a simile about folder structure on a regular computer. I started with folders like `txt`, `pictures`, `video`, `src`, etc. It was super easy to "write" to this. Super easy to decide where to put things. But very hard to "read" - very hard to find what I need.

It's what macOS and Windows do. They have folders like `Pictures` and `Movies`.

Nowadays, I have `projects/`, and each project has everything in it. Source code, notes, asset files, videos, etc.

Group by "goal", not by "type".

This translates to feature-focused architecture.
