        <h1>Bayes’ Theorem</h1>
    </header>

    <p>You have a database of notes and you want to build a system that intelligently assignes tags to the notes. For example, you write a note like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>I found out today that
  we're going to have a baby!
  I am really excited.
</pre></div>
<p>And the system autosuggests adding <code>#life</code> and <code>#baby</code>.</p>
<p>One easy way to do this is through the so-called Bayes&rsquo; theorem. By the end of this article, you&rsquo;ll know what that is and how to use it.</p>
<p>But before we get there, let&rsquo;s first make sure you&rsquo;re really expecting that baby! (I promise this is going to be relevant.)</p>
<h2><a href="#probability-of-babies" name="probability-of-babies"><small>15&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Probability of babies</a></h2>
<p>Pregnancy tests aren&rsquo;t perfect. They can tell you you&rsquo;re expecting when you&rsquo;re not, and they can tell you you&rsquo;re not expecting when you are. In other words, they can be wrong in two ways: there can be <em>false positives</em> (test says yes, but it&rsquo;s incorrect) and there can be <em>false negatives</em> (test says no, but it&rsquo;s incorrect).</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Test says YES</th><th>Test says NO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actual baby</td><td>👶</td><td>True positive</td><td>False negative</td></tr><tr><td>No baby</td><td>◯</td><td>False positive</td><td>True negative</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Although they&rsquo;re not perfect, pregancy tests still do have value, of course. They are <em>mostly</em> correct. Let&rsquo;s say they correctly identify a pregnancy 93% of the time, and correctly identify non-pregnancy 95% of the time.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Test says YES</th><th>Test says NO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actual baby</td><td>👶</td><td>93%</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>No baby</td><td>◯</td><td>5%</td><td>95%</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>So, if you (or your partner) come out of the bathroom with a test result that says YES, what is the probability that you&rsquo;re really having a baby?</p>
<p>You may be tempted to blurt out 93%. But not so fast.</p>
<h2><a href="#prevalence-of-babies" name="prevalence-of-babies"><small>15&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Prevalence of babies</a></h2>
<p>Forget the quality of the test for a moment. What is the probability that, when you&rsquo;re taking a pregnancy test, you&rsquo;re actually pregnant? Note that we&rsquo;re not talking about the precision of any device here. We&rsquo;re talking about how likely it is you&rsquo;re pregnant, in reality, as you&rsquo;re entering the bathroom with the little testing device in your hand.</p>
<p>Now, look, I can&rsquo;t find any good data on this, so I&rsquo;ll just go ahead and estimate. My guess is that only 10% of the women who decide to take a pregnancy test are pregnant at the time.</p>
<aside>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> The actual numbers don&rsquo;t matter at all here. We&rsquo;re not trying to solve a math problem, we&rsquo;re trying to understand Bayes.</p>
</aside>
<p>To find the probabilities of the four different outcomes (true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative) among all the women who take a pregnancy test, we just need to multiply:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Test says YES</th><th>Test says NO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actual baby (10%)</td><td>👶</td><td>93%&nbsp;⨯&nbsp;10%&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>9.3%</strong></td><td>7%&nbsp;⨯&nbsp;10%&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>0.7%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>No baby (90%)</td><td>◯</td><td>5%&nbsp;⨯&nbsp;90%&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>4.5%</strong></td><td>95%&nbsp;⨯&nbsp;90%&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>85.5%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>It might not be immediately obvious, but the four numbers in bold add up to 100%. That makes sense: if you&rsquo;re taking a pregnancy test, you will obviously fall into one of these four categories.</p>
<p>Note the difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a 93% probability that—<em>given that you are having a baby</em>—the test says YES. This is about the quality of the test.</li>
<li>There is a 9.3% probability that a random test-taking woman has a baby <em>and</em> her test says YES. This is about one of the four different outcomes of pregnancy test-taking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first probability is higher because it talks about women who we know to be pregnant. The second probability is lower because it talks about any test-taking woman.</p>
<h2><a href="#total-probability" name="total-probability"><small>15&#8202;.&#8202;3</small> Total probability</a></h2>
<p>So, once again, if you come out of the bathroom with a test result that says YES, what is the probability that you&rsquo;re really having a baby?</p>
<aside>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> This is a very different question than: &ldquo;Given that you&rsquo;re pregnant, what is the probability that your pregnancy test says YES?&rdquo; The answer to <em>that</em> question is 93%.</p>
</aside>
<p>I&rsquo;ll repeat the table from above here, except now it doesn&rsquo;t show percentages, and instead shows whole numbers. All I did was multiply the percentages by 1000, so that instead of looking at fractions, you can imagine four groups of women. I think it makes things a bit more intuitive.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Test says YES</th><th>Test says NO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actual baby</td><td>👶</td><td>93</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>No baby</td><td>◯</td><td>45</td><td>855</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>If you want, you can try to figure it out yourself now. The question, once again, is: &ldquo;Given that your test result says YES, what is the probability that you&rsquo;re really having a baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> We take the group of women with a YES. That is to say, the 93 women with the true positive test, and the 45 women with the false positive test. That&rsquo;s 138 women.</p>
<p>Out of these 138 women, only 93 are actually having a baby. That is to say, 93 out of 138 really are pregnant.</p>
<p>93 divided by 138 is about 67%. That is to say, holding a test result that says YES, the probability you&rsquo;re really pregnant is only 67%.</p>
<aside>
<p>Once again, the actual numbers are made up. I don&rsquo;t actually know the sensitivity of pregnancy tests, or the proportion of women who take them and are pregnant at the time. But the math is correct.</p>
</aside>
<h2><a href="#congrats" name="congrats"><small>15&#8202;.&#8202;4</small> Congrats!</a></h2>
<p><del>It&rsquo;s a girl!</del> You just gained an intuitive understanding of Bayes&rsquo; theorem. It&rsquo;s a way to convert results of a test (e.g. pregnancy strip) into the real probability of an event (e.g. pregnancy).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the mathematical formula:</p>
<p><img src="images/bayes-pregnancy.svg" alt="{\displaystyle P(A|B)={\frac {P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)+P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)}}}" /></p><!-- 
  * LaTex: {\displaystyle P(A|B)={\frac {P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)+P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)}}}
  * converted with https://viereck.ch/latex-to-svg/
  * edited in Sketch
-->
<p>You can read it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that event A occurs given event B<br />
is equal to</li>
<li>the numerator, which is:
<ul>
<li>the probability that event B occurs given event A<br />
times</li>
<li>the probability that event A occurs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>divided by the denominator, which is:
<ul>
<li>the probability that event B occurs given event A<br />
times</li>
<li>the probability that event A occurs<br />
plus</li>
<li>the probability that event B occurs given A <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> occur<br />
times</li>
<li>the probability that event A <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now replace <code>B</code> with &ldquo;pregnancy test says YES&rdquo; and <code>A</code> with &ldquo;you&rsquo;re pregnant&rdquo;.</p><!-- TODO: add the formula with annotations, e.g. P(A) is "probability a test-taking woman is pregnant" -->
<h2><a href="#the-name" name="the-name"><small>15&#8202;.&#8202;5</small> The name</a></h2>
<p>The theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an English Presbyterian minister. His work was published in 1763, so this math is well over 250 years old.</p>
<p><img src="images/Thomas_Bayes.jpg" alt="Thomas Bayes" /></p>
<aside>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> Whenever I get a bit lost in the probabilities of the theorem, I imagine Reverend Bayes looking at me exactly like in the picture above. &ldquo;Really, Filip? You can&rsquo;t multiply two numbers?&rdquo;</p>
</aside>
<p>When we hear &ldquo;Bayes&rdquo; these days, it&rsquo;s either because of the theorem above, or because of a related idea of Bayesian probability. In this approach, probabilities aren&rsquo;t just frequencies (e.g. &ldquo;how many people are over 60 years old?&rdquo;) but can also be strengths of beliefs (e.g. &ldquo;how much do I believe we&rsquo;ll finish the project in time?&rdquo;).</p>
<h2><a href="#automatic-tagging" name="automatic-tagging"><small>15&#8202;.&#8202;6</small> Automatic tagging</a></h2>
<p>Which brings us back to our original problem. We have a note-taking app with 1000 notes that are already tagged by the user. We want a system that automatically suggests tags (like <code>#baby</code>) for new notes based on what&rsquo;s written in them (like <code>"Bought a crib today!"</code>).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take words in the text, and we&rsquo;ll use Bayes to see how probable it is that, given those words, a tag applies. For example, when there&rsquo;s <code>"crib"</code> in the text, how probable is it that the tag <code>#baby</code> applies?</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: center;">Test</th><th style="text-align: center;"></th><th style="text-align: center;">Real event</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;">Pregnancy test says YES</td><td style="text-align: center;">?&rarr;</td><td style="text-align: center;">Pregnancy</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;">One of the words in the text is <code>"crib"</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">?&rarr;</td><td style="text-align: center;">Tag <code>#baby</code> applies</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- TODO: rebuilt into a drawing with arrows, so that it doesn't look like a table -->
<p>It might not seem like it at first but this is essentially the same problem as above. We have a test, and we want to see how indicative it is of a real event.</p>
<p>Once again, if you&rsquo;re up for it, you can try to figure it out yourself. Try to apply Bayes&rsquo; theorem to solve auto-tagging. To scope this down, don&rsquo;t try to solve the whole algorithm at once. Just try to figure out a single pair of word &amp; tag. In other words, find out what&rsquo;s the probability of the tag <code>#baby</code> given the word <code>"crib"</code> in the text. You might want to write things down.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re up for it, stop reading now and go figure it out.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> We want to find the probability that a note should be tagged with <code>#baby</code> <em>given that</em> it contains the word <code>"crib"</code>. That&rsquo;s our <em>P(A|B)</em>. Then, using the formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that a note is tagged with <code>#baby</code> <em>given that</em> it contains the word <code>"crib"</code><br />
is equal to</li>
<li>the numerator, which is:
<ul>
<li>the probability that a note contains the word <code>"crib"</code>  <em>given that</em> it&rsquo;s tagged with <code>#baby</code><br />
times</li>
<li>the probability that a note is tagged with <code>#baby</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>divided by the denominator, which is:
<ul>
<li>the probability that a note contains the word <code>"crib"</code> <em>given that</em> it&rsquo;s tagged with <code>#baby</code><br />
times</li>
<li>the probability that a note is tagged with <code>#baby</code><br />
plus</li>
<li>the probability that a note contains the word <code>"crib"</code> given that it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> tagged with <code>#baby</code><br />
times</li>
<li>the probability that a note is <em>not</em> tagged with <code>#baby</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><!-- TODO: replace with an annotation of the formula -->
<p>In a note-taking app, we know all those values on the right side of the equation.</p>
<p>The following code is just a transcript of the steps above into a programming language. It&rsquo;s here in case you prefer reading code. No need to read through it otherwise.</p>

<p>Actually, there is one other reasons to read the code: to find the divide-by-zero bug that we&rsquo;d need to deal with in a real project. I&rsquo;ll leave that as an exercise to you. Where could the code break and how would you prevent that?</p>
<p>Putting aside trivialities such as division by zero, we&rsquo;re done. Using this code, we can look at words in a new note and compute the probability that the note should be tagged with a particular tag.</p>

<p>As more notes are added and tagged, the system learns automatically. Today, there are no <code>#baby</code>-tagged notes containing the word <code>diaper</code> but trust me: there will be a lot of them in a few short months. And the statistics will just update according to that fact.</p>

<p>From here, it&rsquo;s only a few steps to build an auto-suggestion system. We know the probabilities for individual words, but what we want is the probability of the whole note. After all, we&rsquo;re not trying to tag words, we&rsquo;re trying to tag notes in their entirety.</p>
<p>How do we combine the probabilities of the words into a single probability for the whole note? Now, this would be another <a href="https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath267/kmath267.htm">few pages</a> of probability formulas, so I&rsquo;ll just jump to the conclusion:</p>

<p>In this formula, <em>p</em> is the probability that the whole note should be tagged with <code>#baby</code>. The other numbers (<em>p<sub>1</sub></em> to <em>p<sub>N</sub></em>) are the probabilities of individual words in that note. So, for example, <em>p<sub>1</sub></em> could be the probability that a note with <code>"crib"</code> in it is tagged with <code>#baby</code>. This is what we computed above. Just take those numbers for each of the words in the new note, and plug them in that formula.</p>
<p>Now we get the probability for the whole note:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>$ bayes &quot;Crib arrived today...&quot; &quot;#baby&quot;
83.33%

$ bayes &quot;Yet another round of spreadsheets.&quot; &quot;#work&quot; 
100.00%

$ bayes &quot;Boss called again.&quot; &quot;#baby&quot;
0.00%
</pre></div>

<p>Our system might want to go through all existing tags, and rank them. The tags that are most probable should be suggested to the user.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve left out some details, of course, but you should have no trouble filling in the blanks if you decide to implement Bayes&rsquo; theorem yourself.</p>
<aside>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong> If you&rsquo;re serious about this particular use of Bayes (auto-tagging), you can read Wikipedia&rsquo;s article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering">Bayes spam filtering</a>, which is basically the same thing as tagging (except you only have one tag: <code>#spam</code>).</p>
<p>Another thing to look at is performance, which I chose to completely ignore here. Simple caching of results would take you a long way.</p>
</aside>
<p>The purpose of this article was to give you an intuitive understanding of something quite unintuitive. Bayes is used everywhere from spell checking to driverless cars. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find a use for it in your own work.</p>
<p>If you can compute some ratio (the test), and that ratio is indicative of something interesting (the real event), think about Reverend Bayes.</p>
