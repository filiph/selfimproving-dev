        <h1>You’re not building a career</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Success is always a product of two things: luck and effort. Nobody
became successful because of sheer luck and zero effort. Nobody became
successful because of sheer effort, and no luck.</p>
<p><img src="images/effort-and-luck.png" alt="Effort and luck" /></p>
<p>Remember, luck can come in many ways. My parents weren’t dirt-poor —
luck. My parents weren’t rich — luck (I believe rich upbringing often
leads to low motivation, high expectations and low tolerance of
discomfort in life.) My parents nudged me to study — luck. I was born in
a country that is neither dirt-poor, nor rich — luck. The country
stopped being a totalitarian hell hole about the same time as I was
entering elementary school — luck. My interests involved computers and
programming from an early age — luck. I’m relatively healthy — luck. My
kid is healthy — luck. I could go on and on.</p>
<p>That said, it’s not <em>just</em> luck, is it. I consider myself very lucky, but if I didn’t spend
thousands of hours reading, programming and just plain working with
computers as a teenager, I would be a lot less successful. I’m lucky,
but if I didn’t spend my evenings and weekends working, I would not be
where I am.</p>
<p>It’s not one, or the other. It’s both at the same time.</p>
<p>Don’t despair, though. Nobody is completely without luck, and you can
increase your chances to get lucky by playing at more tables.</p>
<h2><a href="#building-a-career" name="building-a-career"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Building a career</a></h2>
<p>There’s this assumption that a career is to be “built”. As if it was a
wall, or a tower, which you gradually work on, and which slowly but
surely grows.</p>
<p><img src="images/building-career.png" alt="Building" /></p>
<p>But that’s not what’s actually happening, and if you keep acting as if
your career is to be built brick by brick, as if it’s a predictable
linear growth, you’ll seriously limit your chances.</p>
<h2><a href="#embracing-uncertainty" name="embracing-uncertainty"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Embracing uncertainty</a></h2>
<p>Whether you want it or not, you’re playing a lottery. Thankfully, it’s
not a normal lottery (which is always stacked against you). In <em>this</em>
lottery, you can actually come out on top. But it still involves placing
bets, winning and losing.</p>
<p><img src="images/wheels-of-fortune.png" alt="Wheels of Fortune" /></p>
<p>In your life, you’ll meet many risks, opportunities, downturns and
upturns. Your job is to play them to the best of your ability.</p>
<h2><a href="#do-your-work-well-get-more-of-the-same-work" name="do-your-work-well-get-more-of-the-same-work"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;3</small> Do your work well, get more of the same work</a></h2>
<p>If you’re not careful, you can spend your life acting as if you’re
“building” your career. That is to say, for example, you will focus on
being a good employee. You will do the work assigned to you. Sometimes,
you will go above and beyond, working overtime — but only on the things
you are asked to deliver.</p>
<p>The result? You will gradually get better at
what you are doing. You will get a raise. A promotion, even, once in a
while. You will be less likely to be fired when the company hits a rough
patch. So, it’s not a <em>bad</em> approach.</p>
<p>But you should never, ever expect
a fast career growth with this approach.</p>
<h2><a href="#place-bets" name="place-bets"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4</small> Place bets</a></h2>
<p>At any given time, there are thousands of things you could be doing.
After work, you could be watching a TV series. You could be reading
recipes. You could be knitting. You could be arguing with your friends
about politics. You could be daydreaming about being famous. You could
be adding those extra touches to a presentation that your boss asked you
to prepare for her.</p>
<p>Whenever you’re in a position to choose, try to see
it as an opportunity to place a bet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Watching TV.</strong> High probability of being comforted and
entertained. (We all need time to wind down.) No probability of any
lasting impact.</li>
<li><strong>Working on that presentation for your boss.</strong> Good probability of
improving your career a tiny bit. Your current boss will like you a
little more, at least for a while.</li>
<li><strong>Working on a personal project.</strong> Very <em>small</em> probability that
your career will be <em>significantly</em> shifted (project goes viral, or
you get a much better job offer thanks to the project, or someone
talented sees the project and wants to work with you). I list
concrete examples from my own career later in this post.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is to understand that <a href="https://filiph.github.io/unsure/">nothing is
certain</a>. You’re throwing spaghetti at
the wall, and seeing what sticks. You’ll find that most spaghetti don’t
stick. Most of your bets will fail miserably. But you’ll learn through
them. And you’ll at least have a tiny chance, with each new bet, that
you’ll get lucky.</p>
<h3><a href="#what-to-bet" name="what-to-bet"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> What to bet</a></h3>
<p>Most often, you’re betting your free time and your energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning a new programming language is a bet that can cost you
something like a hundred hours. Learning it <em>well</em> can cost you
thousands of hours.</li>
<li>Starting a website will cost you hundreds of hours and at least a
few bucks for hosting.</li>
<li>Starting a new company will cost you thousands of hours and
thousands of dollars. It will also possibly cost you your salary, if
you’re currently employed and planning to quit.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s up to you how much you want to risk. Different people will have
different affinity to risk at different times.</p>
<p>Let’s say there’s an
opportunity to move to a different country. There’s a sizable chance of
an interesting turn in your career. But it also costs time and money to
move, and you estimate there’s a 5% chance you’ll lose it all, and will
have to come back with no money, no prospects, and no place to live.</p>
<p>If you’re a young person with no kids and no health issues, this sounds
like a great bet to place. On the other hand, if you have 2 kids and a
mortgage, those 5% seem pretty scary.</p>
<h3><a href="#examples-from-my-life" name="examples-from-my-life"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Examples from my life</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>As a teenager, I spent hundreds of hours learning Japanese. I knew
that the chances that I’ll put Japanese to any good use, in Czechia,
were slim. Years later, my knowledge of Japanese brought me a
life-changing year in Japan.</li>
<li>One summer, I spent days and nights learning SEO and building my
first big website. This work lead to my first full-time job a few
months later.</li>
<li>The following year, I spent time each day just after work, when
everyone was home, learning Ruby on Rails and building an online
knowledge base about search engine marketing. That work later helped
me land a job at Google.</li>
<li>At Google, as a low-level technical sales person, I spent evenings
and weekends learning various technologies, which let me switch to a
more technical and independent position.</li>
<li>In 2011, I started learning the Dart programming language, spending
(once again) evenings and weekends building real things with it.
Years later, this led me to the Dart team at Google, and to Silicon
Valley.</li>
<li>I spent years thinking about time and the ways we people represent
it. Pretty useless, right? Then I wrote a deceptively simple
<a href="https://twitter.com/year_progress">Twitter bot</a> that currently has
420 thousand followers, and is probably, hilariously, the thing most
people will know me for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to be clear that for every successful example above, there were
hundreds of failures. I tried to become a professional
<a href="http://www.philipage.com/">DJ</a>, I tried to start a Pay-Per-Post
<a href="http://diky.cz/">business</a>, I made
<a href="https://philipage.bandcamp.com/album/2003-2013">music</a>, I wrote
beginnings of books, I built a Natural Language Generation weather
<a href="https://alojz.cz/">app</a>, I co-created a book recommendation
<a href="http://tisicknih.cz/">engine</a>, I built a self-organizing
<a href="https://starmap2d.appspot.com/">map</a> of stars, I wrote fuzzy logic web
<a href="https://filiph.net/fuzzy/">analytics</a>, I learned a lot of stuff that I
will never use. If I knew none of these would pan out, I would have
watched TV instead. But that’s the thing: you don’t ever know what’s
going to work and what isn’t.</p>
<h3><a href="#play-it-safe" name="play-it-safe"><small>3&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;3</small> Play it safe</a></h3>
<p>It takes courage to place bets like these, no matter if you’re young or
old. Remember, nothing is certain. You could place a hundred bets and
still get no results.</p>
<p>So, don’t <em>expect</em> things to go well. Be rather
pessimistic. You should never be <em>surprised</em> that any particular bet was
a failure. Don’t bet it all if you’re not ready to lose it all.</p>
<p>But, do play your career. Don’t just try to linearly build it. Don’t expect
miracles to happen to you just because you’re diligent and hard-working.
Do your job well. Make your boss happy. But also: place bets. Throw
spaghetti at the wall. Play. Your. Career.</p>
